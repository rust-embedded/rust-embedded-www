## No dependencies

Zola comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax
highlighting, table of contents and many other features that
traditionally require setting up a dev environment or adding some
JavaScript libraries to your site.

## Blazing fast

The average site will be generated in less than a second, including
Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.

## Scalable

Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to
handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without
having to worry about managing a server or a database.

## Easy to use

From the CLI to the template engine, everything is designed to be
intuitive. Don't take my word for it though, look at the documentation
and see for yourself.

## Flexible

Zola gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a
blog, a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination of them.

## Augmented Markdown

Zola comes with shortcodes and internal links to make it easier to
write your content.
